# smart-watch
#Things to be done:

#
#WatchData includes three files, one is just an old excel file, which can be ignored.
#The other two files have graphs in them if you download them and open them in excel. 
#These two files are only a few seconds worth of data, but with me moving the watch around quite a lot. 
#Should we look at more normal like data?
